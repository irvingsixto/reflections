What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It is initialize a repository in a hidden folder that stores metadata. It is not created any commit. I need to go to my folder with
cd path, then "git init", finally I could wrote git status to see the status.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a middle area where I decide what archives will be created a commit. The working directory is the folder
where the archives are store and the repository is the .git repository where it is store the data from each commit.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working in a computer that doesn´t have installed Git. Or when I am working collaborative in the platform.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it could be that I doesn´t want to uptadate until I have finish a part of code. For example, if it is updated it could
mark a bug.
